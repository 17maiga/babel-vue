# babel-vue
A Vue.js interface to browse the Library of Babel.  
Works in conjunction with [babel-api](https://github.com/17maiga/babel-api).  
Made as part of a university assignment.

## Installation
Simply clone the project and run the following: 

```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

The project should then be available at [http://localhost:5173].

This project is also available online at [https://babel.17maiga.fr]!

## Main objectives
I was inspired by the official [Library of Babel](https://libraryofbabel.info)
website and wanted to recreate some of the essential features offered by it,
like being able to browse the Library by providing a room id, wall, shelf,
volume and page numbers, ensuring the contents of a book at a given address 
would always be the same, or being able to find text in the Library.

I was able to implement these by reimplementing a very simplified version of the
Library's algorithm and serving it behind an Express.js API. I was then able to
create a coherent user interface to access the data generated by the algorithm.

Users are able to browse the Library by providing a book address (i.e. a room
id, wall, shelf and book numbers) through the `/browse` route, browse a book's
pages through the `/page` route, and find text in the Library through the
`/find` route. 

The API reference is available at [https://github.com/17maiga/babel-api] or at
[https://babel-api.17maiga.fr].
